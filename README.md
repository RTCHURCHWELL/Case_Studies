# Welcome to my case studies!

Hello kind stranger! This repo hosts all research projects I've developed during my undergrad studies in Mobile Development and will be updated regularly as I continue into my field. As a side note, all projects preceded by "CERBERUS" are security related. I plan to release a security suite in the future. 


# Projects

 - **CERBERUS: SAFE SMS** - A P2P Pontifex/Solitaire Cipher based encryption solution for SMS. The algorithm is entirely local and only requires an active mobile account. It also requires that both parties must be running it during use as per the P2P design. This prevents MITM attacks and carrier snooping. This is strictly a POC and is still lacking in essential features. Keystream requires both parties match. A defult keystream of 1 -1 2 3 -2 4 will work for demonstration purposes but any keystream of any length can be used which is what makes the app nearly unbreakable. The -1 and -2 values serve as the Jokers in my mutation algorithm class. More info can be found about Pontifex [HERE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solitaire_%28cipher%29)  

## Using the Android case studies

You can use any build solution to compile the APK. It is GNU so all I ask is you do not sign it as your own and credit where used. Written permission is only needed if used for profit.
